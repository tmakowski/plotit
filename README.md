### Plot it

A Shiny application created during home assignment at an Advanced R course at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science of Warsaw University of Technology.

The goal was to create an app which can visualize a `.csv` data with three different plot geometries (Bartchart, Heatmap, Scatterplot) with a dynamic variable selection. The variable selection is based on the uploaded files columns.
